# Webex Browser SDK Sample Apps

This repository contains Webex sample applications built with the [Webex Browser SDK](https://developer.webex.com/docs/sdks/browser).

## Personal Access Token

These samples use your Webex personal access token to let you easily authenticate. To obtain your personal access you'll need to be logged in to the Developer Portal. Once logged in, open the [Getting Started](https://developer.webex.com/docs/getting-started#accounts-and-authentication) guide and look for **Your Personal Access Token**. Click the copy icon, then click **OK** in the pop-up dialog to copy your access token to the clipboard.
